# TwitterDataAnalysisForAds

* Twitter4J framework to fetch tweets posted from Ankara/Turkey location. 

* Choosing a Text-based advertisement and finding similarities between this advertisement and target users.

* Finding users(target group) who are interested in this advertisement.

* Dividing the target group in connected user clusters. 

* Assuming that when I send advertisement to a person in each cluster, the others can see this advertisement from their cluster members' tweet.

* Agglomerative Clustering algorithm has been used to cluster/categorise target users and Cosine Similarity algorithm to find user similarities between user to user and user to advertisement.
