# TwitterDataAnalysisForAds
I used Twitter4J for collecting tweets from Ankara/Turkey location. 
I chose an Text-based advertisement and find similarities between this advertisement and users.
By the way I can determine which users are interested in this advertisement(my target group).
I also divide this target group in connected people clusters and thus I assume that when I send one people in each cluster,
the others can see my advertisement from their cluster member.
I used agglomerative clustering method to cluster target users and I used cosine similarity method to find user similarities to both each other and to advertisement.
